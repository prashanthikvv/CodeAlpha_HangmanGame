# CodeAlpha_HangmanGame
The Hangman game is a classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word one letter at a time. Each incorrect guess adds a part to a stick-figure drawing of a "hangman." The game ends when the player guesses the word correctly or the hangman drawing is completed.
